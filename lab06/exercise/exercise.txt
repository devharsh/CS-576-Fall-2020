CSS 576 Lab 06
Week 6 - 10/15/2020


Exercise

Tasks:
- Create an exploit as seen during the lab
- Overflow the heap buffer echo_buf so that you write in struct heap_ptrs
- ptrs->val should contain the address of function untouched
- ptrs->fun should point to the top of the stack ($rsp when do_echo is entered)
- If the above are performed correctly untouched should be called instead of do_echo returning to main
